# README

This repository contains basic helper functions in Matlab that I frequently use. They are grouped in folders by topic. I recommend adding these functions to a folder in your Matlab search path or, even better, automatically adding this folder to your search path whenever you start up Matlab by including this line
```
addpath /insert-path-to-this-folder-on-your_system
``` 
in your `startup.m` file.

## Carbonate system calculations

The folder `carbonate_system` contains functions for calculating seawater carbonate system parameters. See the more detailed README in the folder itself.
